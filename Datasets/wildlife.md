# Zoo Animals Extended Dataset
The Zoo Animal Classification Dataset originally consists of 101 animals in a zoo and 16 variables with several features that describe them (the attributes), besides the class to which each animal belongs (the target).

That original dataset is often used in Machine Learning, as it is a complete and yet simple example to practice classification problems with multi-label classes. However, as it provides only a hundred rows, some ML algorithms might not perform well. That is exactly where this extended dataset fits in.

# Zoo Animal Classification
This dataset consists of 101 animals from a zoo.
There are 16 variables with various traits to describe the animals.The 7 Class Types are: Mammal, Bird, Reptile, Fish, Amphibian, Bug and Invertebrate. The purpose for this dataset is to be able to predict the classification of the animals, based upon the variables. It is the perfect dataset for those who are new to learning Machine Learning.

# Biodiversity in National Parks
National Park species lists provide information on the presence and status of species in our national parks. These species lists are works in progress and the absence of a species from a list does not necessarily mean the species is absent from a park. The time and effort spent on species inventories varies from park to park, which may result in data gaps. Species taxonomy changes over time and reflects regional variations or preferences; therefore, records may be listed under a different species name.

Each park species record includes a species ID, park name, taxonomic information, scientific name, one or more common names, record status, occurrence (verification of species presence in park), nativeness (species native or foreign to park), abundance (presence and visibility of species in park), seasonality (season and nature of presence in park), and conservation status (species classification according to US Fish & Wildlife Service). Taxonomic classes have been translated from Latin to English for species categorization; order, family, and scientific name (genus, species, subspecies) are in Latin.

# Animal Species Classification - V3
The vision behind creating this dataset is to have a data set for classifying animal species. A lot of animal species can be included in this data set, which is why it gets revised regularly. This will help to create a machine-learning model that can accurately classify animal species.
