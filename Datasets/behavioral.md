# Inertial data for dog behaviour classification
The dataset includes movement sensor data from sensors placed on the collar and the harness of a dog and recorded while the dog is given tasks or activities to perform. The task are: galloping, lying on chest, sitting, sniffing, standing, trotting, and walking. The movement sensors used are: ActiGraph GT9X Link (ActiGraph LLC, Florida, USA) and they include 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope. The sampling rate used is 100 Hz.

# Mammal Abundance and Behavior in Response to hunting
This dataset provides an insightful look into the various impacts that hunting has on mammal species in two different landscapes - southern Germany and the southeastern United States. Through camera trap data collected from both yards and forests, researchers have gained valuable information on abundance and behaviors as they relate to varying intensities of hunting in each country. Our dataset includes details such as deployment location, habitats, species family name, individual counts per species, county of origin, latitude/longitude coordinates, habitat type and hunter status. With this information we can clearly see how humans affect animal populations by hunting them for sport or sustenance. This resource provides a comprehensive study of mammalian abundance dynamics under differing intensities of hunting across two regions for further exploration into the relationship between human interference and wildlife populations

# CBVD-5(Cow Behavior Video Dataset)
This dataset consists of video data capturing cow behavior, collected using seven surveillance cameras. The cameras used are Dahua cameras with 2.8mm and 3.6mm lenses (model M/K). The data collection process involved the use of Dahua DH-S3000C-16GT 16-port gigabit network switches and Dahua DH-NVR2216-HDS3 network hard disk recorders. The cameras were set up to monitor the cows' daily behavior on the farm continuously for a period of five days, ensuring 24-hour surveillance.

# Wild Brown Rat Predator Response
The dataset contains results of an experiment examining the complex and fascinating antipredator responses of wild brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) to both cat fur and possum fur odour cues in a semi-natural environment. This experiment sought to explore how such animals think, feel, and react when presented with potential danger signals in their environment.

# Animal_behaviour_accelometere_data
HERE WE ARE HAVING ACCELEROMETER DATA ALONG WITH THREE AXES, BASED ON THESE ACCELEROMETER AXES DATA, FIRST WE NEED TO CLUSTER THE DATA IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BEHAVIOR AND AFTER THAT WE NEED TO PREDICT THE RUMINATION FOR ENCOUNTERING EARLY DISEASE USING VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING MODEL.
