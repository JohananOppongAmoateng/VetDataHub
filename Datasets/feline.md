# Feline Reticulocytes
This dataset contains images and labels of feline reticulocytes (an immature red blood cell without a nucleus, having a granular or reticulated appearance when suitably stained). This data was used as the basis of the following paper - Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Determining Reticulocyte Percentage in Cats. The dataset was created using equipment that is easily accessible to veterinarians: a standard laboratory microscope and two types of cameras: a basic microscope camera and a smartphone camera.
