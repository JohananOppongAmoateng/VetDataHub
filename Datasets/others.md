# Animal Condition
The "Animal Condition Classification Dataset" presents a unique and intricate data challenge in the realm of animal health assessment. Featuring a diverse array of animal species, ranging from birds to mammals, this dataset enables the development of predictive models to determine whether an animal's condition is dangerous or not based on five distinct symptoms. The dataset's diversity opens doors to creating a classification system that transcends taxonomic boundaries, making it particularly valuable for people interested in animal welfare and wildlife conservation. However, its manual collection process introduces potential sources of error, including spelling mistakes and variations in symptom representation. This necessitates meticulous data-cleaning efforts

# Animal Bites
In the United States, animal bites are often reported to law enforcement (such as animal control). The main concern with an animal bite is that the animal may be rabid. This dataset includes information on over 9,000 animal bites which occurred near Louisville, Kentucky from 1985 to 2017 and includes information on whether the animal was quarantined after the bite occurred and whether that animal was rabid.

The delightful thing about this data frame is that, anyone who took any biology class in their life can simply understand, use and benefits from. I would love to see how other people would deal with this data frame, I think it is useful and they will be so creative.

# Recognize Animals
Can you train a machine that would tell you the name of animal?
Image recognition is a vital component in robotics such as driverless vehicles or domestic robots. Image recognition is also important in image search engines such as Google or Bing image search whereby you use rich image content to query for similar stuff. Like in Google photos where the system uses image recognition to categorize your images into things like cats, dogs, people, and so on so that you can quickly search your albums for things like, ‚Äúgive me photos of my cat‚Äù, that's awesome.

# Animal Breed - Cats and Dogs
Animal Breed Classification AI Challenge Dataset
The dataset belongs to Dockship's Animal Breed Classification AI Challenge.
The dataset contains images of 37 breeds of cats and dogs from around the world. It contains two directories "TRAIN" and "TEST" with 5890 and 1500 images respectively. The training images are provided in the directory of the specific class itself. The names of the directories are "class labels" to be used for submission. The aim is to classify the "TEST" images into one of the 37 classes.[Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/animal-breed-cats-and-dogs)
