# Animal Condition
The "Animal Condition Classification Dataset" presents a unique and intricate data challenge in the realm of animal health assessment. Featuring a diverse array of animal species, ranging from birds to mammals, this dataset enables the development of predictive models to determine whether an animal's condition is dangerous or not based on five distinct symptoms. The dataset's diversity opens doors to creating a classification system that transcends taxonomic boundaries, making it particularly valuable for people interested in animal welfare and wildlife conservation. However, its manual collection process introduces potential sources of error, including spelling mistakes and variations in symptom representation. This necessitates meticulous data-cleaning efforts.

# Animal Bites
In the United States, animal bites are often reported to law enforcement (such as animal control). The main concern with an animal bite is that the animal may be rabid. This dataset includes information on over 9,000 animal bites which occurred near Louisville, Kentucky from 1985 to 2017 and includes information on whether the animal was quarantined after the bite occurred and whether that animal was rabid.
