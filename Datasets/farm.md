# Effects of On-Farm Hatching on Layer Chicks
This dataset captures the effects of a comparative study between on-farm hatching (OFH) and conventional hatching methods on layer chicks. It explores the short-term stress indicators, long-term cognitive development, factors underpinning learning, and overall animal welfare in relation to these two incubation methods. The data contains detailed observations of chick behaviours (including Asleep/resting, Drinking, Foraging and Spurting behaviours), weight gain measures over time, and cognitive tests in Y-mazes with various paradigms. Corticosterone levels taken before and after transportation have also been documented. The results of this investigative research aim to shed insight into available strategies for improving animal welfare standards for poultry industries worldwide

# Mastitis-Disease-Detection
Mastitis is a common and costly disease affecting dairy cows, characterized by inflammation of the mammary glands. It leads to reduced milk production, poor milk quality, increased veterinary costs, and potential harm to animal welfare.

Clinical Mastitis: This is the most recognizable form of mastitis, characterized by visible signs of inflammation in the udder.

Subclinical Mastitis: Subclinical mastitis is not visibly apparent but can be detected through laboratory tests.
